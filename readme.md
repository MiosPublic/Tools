This repository contains tools, scripts and snippets to perform small tasks such as checking cameras for hidden parameters or features. To run most scripts present here all you have to do is go to your Home Controller's *Develop Apps* tab (**Apps -> Develop Apps -> Test Luup code (Lua)**) and run the code presented here. 

Some scripts require you to change parameters and data within them while others will perform checks through out your network eighter by searching through your ARP list for known mac addresses.
